# User-Classification-AI
Several different machine learning algorithms used to classify User into one of two categories. The csv files contain two sets of data:
training data and test data. The objective is to learn from the training data, in which each column is a feature with the last column
being the label (i.e which category the user belongs to). After learning from the training data, the algorithm has to predict the labels
of the data in the test data, which has the actual labels missing.

Several different algorithms were used from the sci-kit learn library.
